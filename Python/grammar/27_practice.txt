These are tough times for everyone,
but, trust me, it's really not a good time
to be a celebrity, why?
Everyone wants a selfie, everybody.
That's not good, we must keep social distancing,
so I follow specific rules.
Six feet away, no touching.
Check it out, sir!
Sir, what's your name?

Okay, you may have a selfie with me,but you must stay six feet away and no touching! No, I'm good. No, no, you can have a selfie! You can have a selfie with me, but we have to keep our distance. No, I'm good. Do you know who I am? Not really. Tough time to be a celebrity.
